Despite being a stone's throw away from the booming tech hub, the outskirts face financial challenges. The tech boom, instead of lifting all boats, seems to have created a deeper divide. The People's Union calls for a more equitable distribution of the tech wealth. As Silicon Park shines brighter, its outskirts are left in the shadows."
