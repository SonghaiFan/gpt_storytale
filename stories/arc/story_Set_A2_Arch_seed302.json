GreenLife, an environmental group, has started a campaign to save Riverstone Park, the city's last major green space. They argue that the city's rapid development is causing the park to shrink. City Media reported that Dr. Emily Grant, a renowned environmental scientist, supports GreenLife's campaign. She warns of worsening air quality and health risks. Mayor Lina, caught in the middle, promises to find a balance between economic growth and ecological health. The city's future hangs in the balance."
